## Maze Solver

The Maze Solver project implements a maze-solving application using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Java Swing. It provides a graphical interface to visualize maze exploration and pathfinding from the starting point to the goal ('9').

### Features:
- **DFS Algorithm**: Implements Depth-First Search for solving mazes.
- **Java Swing Interface**: Provides an interactive GUI to visualize maze exploration and pathfinding.
- **Path Visualization**: Highlights the path found by the algorithm in real-time.

### Usage:
1. **Run Application**: Execute `NewClass.java` to start the maze solver application.
2. **Navigate Maze**: Interact with the GUI to see maze generation, pathfinding, and solution visualization.
3. **Explore Code**: Dive into the code to understand the DFS algorithm and Java Swing components used.

### Technologies:
- Java
- Java Swing

This project is ideal for learning DFS algorithm implementation and exploring Java Swing for graphical applications.
